<h3>Using Image Files</h3>
<p>Image loading and saving is done with the <b>Image</b> module in LuaAV.  When loading an image, the Image module takes a filename as input and loads the image data in an internal Array object.  The Array object is the generic container for binary data in LuaAV.  It is used by any object that needs to work with large blocks of image or geoemtry data like a Texture or a Mesh.</p>

<p>To display an image in LuaAV, use the Texture object.  Textures are containers of image data in OpenGL and can be applied to geometry such that the image covers a 3D object.  In the simple case of displaying an image, we simply texture a rectangle to show the image undistorted.</p>

<luacode>
-- load the Image module
local Image = require("Image")
local gl = require("opengl")
local GL = gl
local sketch = require("opengl.sketch")
-- load the opengl.Texture module
local Texture = require("opengl.Texture")

local ctx = "Image Display"
win = Window(ctx)

-- load a file in a LuaAV search path
local img = Image(LuaAV.findfile("hubble.jpg"))
-- create a texture and associate it with the OpenGL context
local tex = Texture(ctx)
-- load the texture with the image data
tex:fromarray(img:array())

function win:draw()
	-- draw the image
	tex:bind()
	gl.Color(1, 1, 1, 1)
	gl.Begin(GL.QUADS)
		sketch.quad()
	gl.End()
	tex:unbind()
end
</luacode>

<p>Like most functions that take file names as arguments, the Image constructor needs an absolute path.  In LuaAV, there are a number of ways to convert a file name into an absolute path file name.  <b>LuaAV.findfile</b> will search through the registered search paths for a file and return an absolutel path.  If a file is located relative to a script, you can use the global <b>script.path</b> variable to prepend the script relative path and convert it into an absolute one.</p>

<p>When creating the Texture object, notice the argument above is a variable called 'ctx'.  This is short for context.  This variable must also be the title of the Window holding the OpenGL rendering context.  All OpenGL objects work this way in LuaAV.  OpenGL objects maintain context-specific resoures that must be properly created and destroyed in sync with the rendering context in the Window.  These resoruces get a signal based on the name of the Window when they need to destroy and re-create themselves, so setting this up properly is very important.</p>

<p>To load the image data into a texture, we use the <b>Texture:fromarray()</b> function and pass it the Array object returned by <b>Image:array()</b>.  To draw with the Texture, we first have to <i>bind</i> it so that OpenGL knows to use it whenever any geoemtry is drawn, so the first drawing operation is a call to <b>Texture:bind()</b>.  Once bound, a Texture will be applied to any subsequently drawn shapes.  Here, we use the handy <b>sketch.quad()</b> function, which draws a rectangle with appropriate texture coordinates.  Without texture coordinates, no image would appear on the rectangle.  The texture coordinates specify how pixels in the Texture are mapped to the vertices of the rectangle.</p>

<p>Finally, we call <b>Texture:unbind()</b> to disable the Texture from use in OpenGL.  For every Texture:bind() call, there must be a matching Texture:unbind() call in order to rendering state to remain consistent.</p>

<h3>Rendering to Texture</h3>
<p>While texture can be used to draw with image files, they can also be used to store intermediate drawings that are then used to compose the final result.  This is typically refered to as render-to-texture because all of the OpenGL rendering goes to a Texture instead of the Window.</p>

<luacode>
tex:startcapture()
	-- draw a sequence of vertical lines
	gl.Begin(GL.LINES)
	for x=-1, 1, 0.1 do
		gl.Vertex(x, -1)
		gl.Vertex(x, 1)
	end
	gl.End()
tex:endcapture()
</luacode>

<p>To render to a texture, create a Texture object and then use the <b>Texture:startcapture</b> and <b>Texture:endcapture</b> functions to start and end rendering to the texture.  Any OpenGL commands called between startcapture and endcapture will be directed to the Texture itself.  Once endcapture is called, the Texture can be used just like in the image loading case to color geometry.</p>

<h3>Post-Processing Texture</h3>
<p>One of the most common uses for rendering to texture is that the resulting Texture can be post-processed with an image-based filter such as a blur or mixing filter.  In LuaAV, the <b>Slab</b> object performs Texture processing.  It takes Textures as input and calculates the result in an output Texture. The specific filter is defined by a shader file loaded into the Slab object. Here is an example showing how to blur a Texture:</p>

<luacode>
local gl = require("opengl")
local GL = gl
local sketch = require("opengl.sketch")
local Texture = require("opengl.Texture")
local Slab = require("opengl.Slab")

local ctx = "Blurry"
win = Window(ctx)

local tex = Texture(ctx)
local blurx = Slab{
	ctx = ctx,
	-- two-pass gaussian blur
	file = LuaAV.findfile("cf.gaussian.2p.shl"),
	param = {
		width = {1/tex.dim[1], 0},	-- blur in the x-direction
	}
}
local blury = Slab{
	ctx = ctx,
	-- two-pass gaussian blur
	file = LuaAV.findfile("cf.gaussian.2p.shl"),
	param = {
		width = {0, 1/tex.dim[2]},	-- blur in the y-direction
	}
}

function win:draw()
	tex:startcapture()
		-- red
		gl.Color(1, 0.2, 0.2, 1)
		-- draw a sequence of vertical lines
		gl.LineWidth(3)
		gl.Begin(GL.LINES)
		for x=-1, 1, 0.1 do
			gl.Vertex(x, -1)
			gl.Vertex(x, 1)
		end
		gl.End()
	tex:endcapture()
	
	-- blur the Texture
	blurx:draw(tex)
	blury:draw(blurx)
	
	-- get the blurred result
	sketch.enter_ortho()
	local outtex = blury:texture()
	outtex:bind()
	gl.Color(1, 1, 1, 1)
	gl.Begin(GL.QUADS)
		sketch.quad()
	gl.End()
	outtex:unbind()
	sketch.leave_ortho()
end
