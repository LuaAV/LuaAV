LuaAV is an audiovisual scripting environment developed for real-time applications.  It is developed at the Media Arts and Technology program at UC Santa Barbara.  The primary authors are Wesley Smith and Graham Wakefield.  See http://lua-av.mat.ucsb.edu/ for more information.

Currently LuaAV runs on OSX and Linux using Qt.  On OSX, we use xcode projects for building the application and on Linux, we use a custom build system that only depends on having the Lua language installed along with the usual GCC command-line tools.


Build instructions OSX:
--------------------------
1) cd buildtool/osx
2) open luaavmake.xcodeproj
	
	There are 2 targets in this project: 'lfs' and 'build'.  'lfs' ony build the LuaFileSystem module that the buildtool needs to navigte the file system.  'build' is an aggregate target that builds 'lfs' and executes the build script (build.osx.lua).  the build script will searc through the repository, building the binary modules and the LuaAV library and application.  Dependeing if the Debug or Release configuration is enabled, you will have a full build of LuaAV in sysbuild/Debug or sysbuild/Release.
	
	Once the lfs target is built the first time, the build script can also be invoked from the command-line directly without having to open the Xcode project.  For example:
	
	1) cd buildtool
	2) lua build.osx.lua ../
		Alternatives:
			2a) lua build.osx.lua ../ -config=Release
			2b) lua build.osx.lua ../ -config=Release -action=clean
			2c) lua build.osx.lua ../ -action=clean
			
	The config option defaults to 'Debug' and the action option defaults to 'make'.
	
	

Build instructions LINUX (tested under Ubuntu 9.10):
--------------------------

Setup:
--------
1) cd buildtool/scripts
2) sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
	This script will install all dependencies and only needs to be run once on any given machine.  Most importantly for building LuaAV, the script will install Lua, which is needed to run the LuaAV build scripts. 
3) cd ../src
4) make linux
	This will build the only binary dependency for the build tool, which is the Lua module LuaFileSystem.  It will be installed in buildtool/modules.


Build LuaAV
--------
1) cd buildtool
2) lua build.linux.lua ../
	Alternatives:
			2a) lua build.linux.lua ../ -config=Release
			2b) lua build.linux.lua ../ -config=Release -action=clean
			2c) lua build.linux.lua ../ -action=clean

	The config option defaults to 'Debug' and the action option defaults to 'make'.

The buildtool will build all binary modules and the LuaAV application including any shared libraries such as libluaav and libmuro.  During the build process, these will be installed in /usr/local/lib.  If your system is not already setup to load shared libraries from /usr/local/lib, you will need to edit /etc/ld.conf.so and run ldconfig.  The buildtool will also install resources such as the LuaAV icon into /usr/share/luaav.  Final builds will be located in sysbuild/Debug and sysbuild/Release.
