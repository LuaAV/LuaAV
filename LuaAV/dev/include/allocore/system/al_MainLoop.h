	al_main can be used within an existing application mainloop, or can create its own
	
	1. Create a mainloop to take over the main thread (e.g. console tools)
		
		a) Enter the mainloop using:
			al_main_enter()
				This will implicitly call al_main_init() in case it hadn't already been called.
				This function does not return until al_main_exit() is called.
				Until it returns it makes frequent implicit calls to al_main_tick()
		
		b) Manually trigger the mainloop to exit by calling:
			al_main_exit()
				This will implicitly release the main loop, and al_main_enter() will return.
				Also calls the main_quit_handler (if supplied)
	
	2. Using an existing application mainloop with built-in timer (e.g. OSX apps)
	
		a) Attach to the current OS runloop using:
			al_main_attach()
				This will implicitly call al_main_init() in case it hadn't already been called.
				It attaches a timer to the current OS runloop to implicitly call al_main_tick()
				Returns immediately.
		
		b) When the runloop exits, it is your responsibility to call:
			al_main_exit()
				Also calls the main_quit_handler (if supplied)
	
	3. Using an existing application mainloop with manual timer (e.g. GLUT apps)
		
		a) Manually initialize mainloop during startup:
			al_main_register() 
				You must call this before calling al_main_tick()
				
		b) Manually trigger mainloop at frequent intervals:
			al_main_tick()
				Call this function frequently, e.g. in a draw callback 
				
		c) Manually release mainloop once the application is closing:
			al_main_exit()
				You must not make any other calls into mainloop after al_main_exit()
				Also calls the main_quit_handler (if supplied)
