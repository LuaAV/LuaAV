/*  Purpose */
/*  ======= */

/*  SLABAD takes as input the values computed by SLAMCH for underflow and */
/*  overflow, and returns the square root of each of these values if the */
/*  log of LARGE is sufficiently large.  This subroutine is intended to */
/*  identify machines with a large exponent range, such as the Crays, and */
/*  redefine the underflow and overflow limits to be the square roots of */
/*  the values computed by SLAMCH.  This subroutine is needed because */
/*  SLAMCH does not compensate for poor arithmetic in the upper half of */
/*  the exponent range, as is found on a Cray. */

/*  Arguments */
/*  ========= */

/*  SMALL   (input/output) REAL */
/*          On entry, the underflow threshold as computed by SLAMCH. */
/*          On exit, if LOG10(LARGE) is sufficiently large, the square */
/*          root of SMALL, otherwise unchanged. */

/*  LARGE   (input/output) REAL */
/*          On entry, the overflow threshold as computed by SLAMCH. */
/*          On exit, if LOG10(LARGE) is sufficiently large, the square */
/*          root of LARGE, otherwise unchanged. */

/*     If it looks like we're on a Cray, take the square root of */
/*     SMALL and LARGE to avoid overflow and underflow problems. */
