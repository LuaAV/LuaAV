<h3>Creating a Window</h3>
<p>Real-time drawing in LuaAV uses <a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> for hard-ware accelerated 3D graphics.  The <b>Window</b> class in LuaAV automatically creates and enables an OpenGL context when it is created, so setting up drawing requires only a few lines of code.  Windows are created by using the global <b>Window</b> function:</p>

<luacode class="inline-fragment">
win = Window("Title")
</luacode>

<p>Windows should be set to global variables like in the above code so that they won't be garbage collected. Position and size arguments can be set after the Window title:</p>

<luacode class="inline-fragment">
-- title, position, size
win = Window("Title", 0, 0, 512, 512)
</luacode>

<p>
Once a Window is created, we need to create callback functions for it in order to receive mouse, keyboard, and most importantly drawing events.  The full list of Window events is listed in the <a href="file:///Users/wesleysmith/Documents/LuaAV/luaAV/git/LuaAV/buildtool/utilities/docs/app.Window.html#details"><b>app.Window</b> documentation</a>.  All of the Window callbacks are <i>instance</i> methods, meaning the first parameter is the Window object itself followed by any other arguments.
</p>

<luacode>
win = Window("Title")

-- key callback, ':' indicates instance function with an implicit 'self' argument
function win:key(event, key)
	if(event == "down") then
		if(key == 27) then
			-- toggle fullscreen when the 'esc' key is pressed
			self.fullscreen = not self.fullscreen
		end
	end
end

-- draw callback, rate is set by win.fps attribute
function win:draw()
	-- draw graphics here
end
</luacode>

<h3>Drawing with OpenGL</h3>
<p>When a Window is first created and has an empty <b>draw</b> function, the Window will simply show its default <b>clearcolor</b>, which is black by default.  Inside the <b>draw</b> function, the Window's OpenGL context is active and can be used to display graphics.  An OpenGL context represents all of the operating system and hardware resources required to use OpenGL.  It must be active in order for drawing to work properly.  The only callbacks where drawing can be done are in the <b>draw</b>, <b>key</b>, and <b>mouse</b> functions.</p>

<p>All of the OpenGL drawing functionality is contained in the <b>opengl</b> module.  It contains both low-level OpenGL functions such as glBegin, glVertex, glEnd, etc. as well as higher-level objects for managing more complex operations involving textures, shaders, image processing, and so on.  The OpenGL module is not automatically loaded into LuaAV scripts, so it must be required in order to use it.  The following code draws a white square:</p>

<luacode>
local gl = require("opengl")
local GL = gl	-- alias the opengl module to mimic C-style OpenGL code

win = Window("Square")
function win:draw()
	-- set the current color to white
	gl.Color(1, 1, 1, 1)
	-- draw a square
	gl.Begin(GL.QUADS)
		gl.Vertex(-1, 1)
		gl.Vertex(1, 1)
		gl.Vertex(-1, -1
		gl.Vertex(1, -1)
	gl.End()
end
</luacode>

<p>As another example, we can draw bunches of lines spraying out from where the mouse cursor was pressed.  To do this, we use the <b>mouse</b> callback along with some math functions and the <b>opengl.sketch</b>.</p>

<luacode>
local gl = require("opengl")
local GL = gl
local sketch = require("opengl.sketch")

win = Window("Spray Lines")
-- turn of the clearing of frames between each draw
win.autoclear = false

lastpos = {256, 256}
function win:mouse(event, btn, x, y)
	if(event == "down" or event == "drag") then
		lastpos = {x, y}
	end
end

function win:draw()
	-- Turn of depth testing, turn on blending (additive)
	gl.Disable(GL.DEPTH_TEST)
	gl.Enable(GL.BLEND)
	gl.BlendFunc(GL.SRC_ALPHA, GL.ONE)

	-- enter orthographic (2D) drawing mode and
	-- scale the coordinates to match the pixel dimensions of the window
	sketch.enter_ortho(self.dim)
	
	gl.Begin(GL.LINES)
	-- scale the radius by the y-coordinate
	local radius = (lastpos[2]/self.dim[2])^0.5*80
	for i=1, 100 do
		gl.Color(0, 0, 0, 0)
		gl.Vertex(lastpos)
		gl.Color(1, 1, 1, 0.1)
		-- make a random point on a circle 'radius' pixels from the mouse position
		local theta = math.random()*math.pi*2
		gl.Vertex(
			radius*math.cos(theta)+lastpos[1],
			radius*math.sin(theta)+lastpos[2]
		)
	end
	gl.End()
	
	-- end orthographic drawing mode
	sketch.leave_ortho()
end
