    Neighand: Neighborhood Handling library

    The goal of this class is to find 3D neighbors efficiently.
    It stores the position of objects in 3D. The user can then ask what
    are the neighbor objects for any given point, within a radius
    (aka locality query, or neighborhood search).

    Read the documentation contained in the article "Query Sphere
    Indexing for Neighborhood Requests" for details.

Force inlining of some functions.
The compiler may think they are too big, and that's usually perfectly justified.
A too big inlined function is actually less performant than a call, because the call
re-uses the code trace L1 cache whereas the duplication due to inlining does not.
However, in our case, some "big" functions are called within critical neighborhood
loops, and only there. Some other functions are just placed in a separate class so
as to make use of template specialization, and should be inlined too.

//// PART 1: Initialization & destruction

    // min(x|y|z) is the corner of the region of interest in world coordinates.
    //            It is especially important in case there is no wrapping
    //            along at least one direction.
    // cellSize is the edge size of the cubic cells (the same for each direction).
    //          Thus, for non-cyclic worlds, min[xyz] + cellSize * 2^exp2div[xyz]
    //          is the corner with maximum coordinate for the region of interest.
    // objectInitCapacity: Initial capacity in number of objects. Memory is reserved
    //                     to hold that max amount of objects, and will be increased
    //                     if necessary. Use this parameter to avoid run-time memory

//// PART 2: Managing user objects in the region of interest

    // Insert a user object at the given location (world coordinates)
    // The object can then be considered in the neighborhood queries.
    // Return a proxy = a key identifier for this object
    // Note: It may be that some user object / ObjectProxy mappings are changed in the process.
    //       The rationale for the change is an optimization of memory (see the "remove" function notes).
    //       If the change matters (and it probably does to your application) then provide a mapper functor
    //       That mapper functor should have the (UserObject*, ObjectProxy<UserObject>*) signature
    //       and should change the given user-object-to-ObjectProxy mapping
    // Example: Your objects have an internal "proxy" field. Then the mapper should change
    //          that field to the new updated proxy for that object: object->proxy = updated_proxy
    //          See also the example ProxiedObjectRemapperFunctor in neighand_structures.h which does exactly that.

    // Remove an object proxy from the neighborhood considerations.
    // The proxy must have been returned by "insert" and must be removed only once.
    // Rationale: Object proxies are stored internally as a contiguous memory array for maximum performances.
    //            When removing an object the proxy used by that object is replaced by the one at the end
    //            of the array, so the end-of-array element may then be deallocated.
    //            The mapper is called during this operation to maintain the user object/proxy correct associations.
    //            The alternative from v0.1 is a simpler API that really removes, but cause memory fragmentation.
    //            The apparent save in complexity from the simpler API is thus just shifted to a defrag
    //            or equivalent utility, which the user then has to handle. Or possibly garbage collection,
    //            auto-defrag, etc, which then causes perf problems at one point or another in addition to
    //            having to deal with non-contiguous memory arrays which induce processing costs too.
    //            On the other hand updating an external ref is as easy as an affectation, real fast constant-time,
    //            avoids further mem frag problems, and allows for very efficient traversal routine for the
    //            linear memory array that would not be possible with fragged memory.

//// PART 3: Neighborhood query functions


    /* Set the method to use for the queries.
        One method may be better than the others according to the query distance, number of objects, size of world, wrapping or not...
        General guidelines:
        - Small distances are better handled by the Cube method (aka bin-lattice norm-1 query). "Small" may mean a tenth of the cell size for high loads, or a few cells for very low loads. You might also consider changing the discretization size in these cases.
        - Large distances are better handled by either the non-empty list or the brute force. Use the non-empty list if you expect that your objects are concentrated in a few cells which may be rejected in one go with a single distance check. Use the brute force method otherwise as it has the lowest setup and per-processed-object costs (but it processes all objects).
        - Sphere generally works best for all intermediate query distances, especially in wrapping worlds and for high load ratios. Sphere also has a premature stopping cabability which make it well adapted to K-nearest neighbors.
        - Auto selects at run-time which method to use. The estimated volumes that will be processed by each method are multiplied by weights to reflect their different processing costs, then the method with estimated lowest cost is chosen. The interest is that according to the position of the query center in a non-wrapping world the Sphere and Cube methods may have varying volumes inside the region of interest, hence the Auto method allows to dynamically choose which is the best method.
        Default is Auto but with equal weights. Tuning these parameters may get you the best of the library. Try playing with the other methods too, if one of them is best suited to your application then you may avoid the (slight) cost of the weighting scheme.
